# webapp-ML_project-Property_price_prediction
Developed a Property Price Prediction model using regression techniques to estimate rental prices based on features like size, location, and amenities. Integrated the model into a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions and easy user interaction

🏡 Property Price Prediction Web App
This project is a Property Price Prediction Web App that estimates rental property prices based on various input features. The app is built using machine learning for the predictive model and Flask for the web application interface.

🚀 Features
Predicts property rental prices based on:

Size (sq. ft)

Property Type (Flat/House)

Number of Bedrooms

Distance to key landmarks (AP, AIIMS, NDRLW)



Interactive and user-friendly web interface

Real-time predictions

🧠 Machine Learning Model
Regression-based model trained on a dataset containing historical rental data.

Data preprocessing and feature engineering performed to improve prediction accuracy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (via Flask templates)

Backend: Python, Flask

ML: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
